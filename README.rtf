\f0\fs24 \cf0 For this assignment, we have divided the work evenly. Kaiyi Zhang is responsible for Sequential Command Builder, Simple Prompt Filter, Wc Filter and Grep Filter. She also wrote IncorrectComFilter and PrintFilter files to make sure the program works. Nina Xu is responsible for writing Pwd, ls, cat, cd, uniq filter and Sequential REPL file. In the end, we collaborated together for debugging to pass JUnit tests.}
